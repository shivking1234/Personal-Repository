        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
            Hey there! I'm Shivansh Agrawal, a Class 10 student at Elpro International School, and I'm thrilled to have you on my website!

Chess, coding, and robotics are my true passions. Chess is more than just a game; it's a mind-boggling challenge that hones my strategic thinking. Analyzing games and mastering different openings keeps me engaged for hours. Coding, on the other hand, is my creative outlet. I enjoy building websites and solving coding puzzles that push my limits. Robotics is where my imagination soars. Designing intelligent machines and making them interact with the world amazes me.

Besides my hobbies, I prioritize excelling in academics to pave the way for my future aspirations. But life is not just about work and studies. Spending time with my loved ones, sharing laughter, and creating memories are equally vital to me.

As I progress in my educational journey, my dream is to merge my interests in chess, coding, and robotics. I want to explore the fields of Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning, making a positive impact on society.

Thank you for stopping by! If you share any of my passions or have exciting ideas to collaborate, feel free to reach out. Let's connect and embark on a fantastic journey of discovery and growth together!

            <p>
                
My object detection program utilizes advanced deep learning models and image processing techniques to accurately identify and locate objects in images and video streams. With a user-friendly interface, users can upload images or access live video feeds for real-time analysis. The program can detect a wide range of objects, and users have the flexibility to customize detection parameters. Privacy and security are prioritized as all processing is performed locally. The program also provides detailed reports with annotated images and object statistics. Through this project, I aim to contribute to the advancement of computer vision and its applications in diverse fields.
